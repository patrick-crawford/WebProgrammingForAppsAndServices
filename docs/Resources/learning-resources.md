# Learning resources

Here you will find information about and links to learning resources that you will use in this course.

## Developer tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (info, download)
  - [Getting started docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- Browsers (current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge)
- Browser dev tools
- HTTP inspector (e.g. [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/))
- [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/)
- [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
- [jsBin](https://jsbin.com)
- Other dev tools will be introduced as we make progress through the weekly topics

You will need one or more devices. A College or personal desktop or laptop, and (likely) a personal mobile device (e.g. a smartphone).

## Required textbook

None. This is a web programming course therefore, the best source for content is on the web!

## Required online resources

There are several required online resources:

- The Mozilla Developer Network **MDN Web Docs** web site is vast, with thousands of documents. It is a trusted and authoritative source for web developer information. Of interest:

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML) Guide, including [HTML Forms Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms), and the [HTML5 Element List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list)

- [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

- JavaScript Reference

  - [JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  - (Also suggested) [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

- [DOM Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM)

> In October 2017, Microsoft, Google, and the W3C committed to making _MDN Web Docs_ the single authoritative source for web developer documentation.  
> Read more about this in an [article by Ali Spivak](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/18/mozilla-brings-microsoft-google-w3c-samsung-together-create-cross-browser-documentation-mdn/).

**Others:**

- [Bootstrap (version 3) CSS documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/)  
  Links to other topics (e.g. Getting started, etc.) are on that page

- Official [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-starteds)

- Node Reference

  - [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
  - (Suggested) [nodejitsu](https://docs.nodejitsu.com/)

- [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)

- [TypesScript Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)

Oh, and you should must know (and love!) the series of RFCs that describe HTTP, [7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) through 7235. If you want a friendlier introduction to [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), read its Wikipedia article.

## Other resources

- [W3C Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/)

- Google [web developers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/) content

**Front end frameworks**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Alternatives:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) (which is NOT AngularJS, a legacy technology)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- and many others...

**State management**

- [JSON data API - jsonplaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

<!--**To be categorized**
RxJS (ReactiveX library for JavaScript) - compose async and event-based programs using observables and LINQ-style queries
Was known as "Reactive Extensions"
[reactivex.io - official docs](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html#introduction) -->

**HTML and CSS**

- [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) - MDN
- [CSS Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) - MDN

## Visual Studio Code tips and info

**Start VS Code from the command line**

Make sure that you're in your project folder.  
Then type this command: `code .`

> **NOTE:** This assumes that your computer is configured to run this command. See the [Running VS Code on Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) to configure that feature.

<br />

**Useful keyboard shortcuts**

Trigger IntelliSense: `Control + Space`

Toggle comments on/off: `Command + /`

Reformat document: `Shift + Option + Command + F`

Show/hide left-side bar: `Command + B`

Show/hide terminal: `Control + (back-tick)`

Markdown preview pane toggle on/off: `Command + K, V`

**Useful Emmet snippets**

For most elements, just begin typing the element name, without the angle bracket.

`.` Declare class(es), e.g. `div.row`

`#` Declare unique identifier, e.g. `table#customers`

`>` Child, e.g. `div>p`

`*` Multiplier, e.g. `ul>li*5`

`( )` Grouping, often used with multiplier

`+` Sibling, e.g. `div>h3+p*3`

`{blahblah}` Text content for an element, e.g. `h3{Hello, world!}`

`[` Custom attribute, e.g. `span[data-bind`

See the [Emmet cheat sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) for full coverage.
